Heart Disease Prediction:
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

Features:
->Data cleaning and preprocessing
->Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
->Machine learning model training
->Accuracy evaluation and prediction

Technologies Used:
->Python
->Pandas, NumPy
->Scikit-learn
->Matplotlib / Seaborn
->Jupyter Notebook

Goal: To help in early detection of heart disease by analyzing medical data and predicting risk levels.
